    "title": "ABOUT",
    "main1": "Amarena Pictures is a production and direction company.",
    "main2": "It was born in 2011, distinguishing itself for its adaptivity and its ability to work quickly while maintaining effectiveness and high quality. We create different genre advertising films such as branded content, VR, or even videogames that have been broadcasted on TV, web, social media and internal or corporate communication channels. It is our pride to meet our clients and advertising agencies needs.",
    "main3": "<i>\"Amarena Pictures represents that unique taste made of a human side and an aesthetic research that is felt in all the contents we produce. This derives precisely from our love for what is ‘human’: even when we film Bulgari rings or an Alfa Romeo we still give a human touch in the moving images style: today the product itself is not more important than the desire, the history, and the choice of the consumer.\"</i>",
    "main4": "We have been working with top brands like FCA, Coca-Cola, Netflix, Lavazza, Bulgari, Tim, Mercedes, Mazda, Procter & Gamble, Beiersdorf, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Ministry of Health, and Presidency of the Council of the Ministers.",
    "main5": "Alessandro Merletti De Palo and Giovanni Caloro are two directors who have chosen to transform the pre-production, the set, and the post-production into a single pleasant, creative, non-mechanical path.",
    "main6": "Our goal is to combine precision, quality, promptness and maintaining at the same time a pleasant, artistic, and relaxed atmosphere from the B2B relationship during production.",
    "main7": "Thanks to the contribution of all the professionals involved and our producers – the \"amarena guys\" – we are always ready, available, and friendly ...with the constant intention to become impeccable.",
    "main8": "With Amarena, everything can be done with care and precision, in a caring and intelligent mood.",
    "main9": "THAT'S AMARENA!"

    "amdp1": "🍒👨🌈 Alessandro Merletti De Palo:",
    "amdp2": "Director and scientific researcher, founder of Amarena Pictures together with Giovanni Caloro.",
    "amdp3": "💗 He strongly believes in the potential of the people around him and, like Amarena Pictures, he loves diversity, not only of gender or sexual orientation but also of mindset, social class, and beliefs. 🎬 After several documentaries and a medium-length film, he's for his only time Spike Lee's assistant director in shooting a commercial film. This experience introduces him in the commercial film direction world. 🧠 On the scientific side, he presented his Cooperation Science thesis at several international conferences including two Collective Intelligence Conferences held by MIT: in Silicon Valley and at the NYU Stern School of Business.",
    "amdp4": "❌ His love for creativity and diversity is so strong that he hates to repeat activities and concepts several times. Don’t ask him to repeat! Very risky! 😂",
    "amdp5": "💬 His motto: 'Si Tu Bene Es Ego Quidem Valeo'",
    "gio1": "🍒👨🏻🌈 Giovanni Caloro:",
    "gio2": "🖖 He was born in Rome in 1981. Director, avant-gardener founder of Amarena Pictures together with Alessandro Merletti De Palo.",
    "gio3": "🎬 Vj and musician during his college days (thesis in theatre history, on 'The Representation of Hell in the Medieval Theatre'), fascinated by the interaction between music and images, approaches directing by filming video clips, dance videos, and art videos. He listens only to music produced until 1995 (with very few exceptions), loves TV series, David Lynch, David Fincher and Stanley Kubrick. At home he has only 2 Dvds, both signed by the movie directors: Blue Velvet and The Matrix.",
    "gio4": "❌ If you’re in a conference call with him: he’s not shy, he just forgot the microphone off! 😂",
    "gio5": "💬 His motto: 'Danzi mai col diavolo nel pallido plenilunio?'",
    "ari1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Arianna Giri:",
    "ari2": "Producer",
    "ari3": "🎥 Dynamic, sunny, decisive, tattooed. Very smart young girl, you recognize her immediately. She also worked in the editorial offices of Sky TG24 and Le Iene (Mediaset group), consolidating her practical knowledge of the field. 🍾 Her outstanding PR skills leave no one a chance: a second before you are in the office with her and a second after you find yourself having an aperitif with the pass for a privée in your pocket and the drink in your hand.🔝Active and extremely punctual in the production organization, manages to skillfully navigate between calls to suppliers and relationships with agencies and customers. If you want to break the ice with ease and immediacy (and a few more spritzes), you should contact her.",
    "ari4": "❌ Despite her slim physique ⚠️she does not eat healthy foods, fish, vegetables but only hamburgers, chips, nutella ... her beloved 'crap food'! 😂",
    "ari5": "💬 Her motto: 'Live with ambition to accomplish your dreams'",
    "bea1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Beatrice Caimi:",
    "bea2": "Assistant Producer",
    "bea3": "🎬 Bright, nerdy, she never wears black. ☀️ She graduated in languages and then attended a master in Tv studies. 📺 If she had to choose a century to live in, it would be the 1800s... you’d find her in a beautiful estate or in a castle. If she could, she’d live on the set of The Crown...even though it wouldn’t be so bad to be also on the set of Game of Thrones or Star Wars. ⚠️ Never stop with her at a comic book store or a bookshop before a meeting, otherwise you’ll regret it. In her free time she writes custom lists of tv shows for her friends to watch; Netflix’s algorithm is nothing compared to her! She’ll always be the first one to know what happens in any remote corner of the world: we call her BBC.",
    "bea4": "❌ Never put her to bed without pasta.",
    "bea5": "💬 Her motto: 'Do or do not... there is no \"try\"'",
    "chiara1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Chiara Nicolini:",
    "chiara2": "Assistant Producer",
    "chiara3": "🎥 Lively, determined, opened to a thousand adventures. Media and advertising student at IULM, she always wanted to work on sets. 🎬 She's very young but we warn you, don't try to hinder or stop her because you'll lose in the beginning. Super dynamic, in the office and on the set you can recognize her for her desire to do and her smile (even under the mask!). 📸 She loves taking photos around her, being updated about fashion photography, constantly looking for the perfect bag to buy. ✈️ Suggest her to go on a weekend trip and she will love you forever.",
    "chiara4": "❌ She has an addiction to Japanese sandwiches called \"mo\"; don't eat any in front of her or it might end badly.",
    "chiara5": "💬 Her motto: 'Ithaca gave you the good trip, without her you would never have set out. What else do you expect?'",
    "emilia1": "🍒👩🏼🌈 Emilia Apperti:",
    "emilia2": "Junior Marketing and Strategy",
    "emilia3": "☀️ Dynamic, extroverted and always smiling. The sun is her symbol and the color yellow is her spirit animal. It’s impossible to make her sit still, she’s always taking risks and running towards new challenges! There’s no way to stop her creativity. 🎬 She has a business degree from Bocconi, with a thesis on how the cinema industry was influenced by streaming platforms: the movie theater is her second home. 💛 People say about her that she can make trees talk. Whatever the subject, she can engage in any conversation (it’s way harder to make her stop talking): she believes her curiosity to be her most precious weapon. 🌈 Feminist to the core and incurable optimist: for her, problems do not exist, only solutions. Precise, strong, attentive to detail and always ready to bend over backwards to do a good job.",
    "emilia4": "❌ If she doesn’t hear you when you call, or see you on the street, don’t worry: she’s just listening to music at full volume through her headphones, pretending she’s in a videoclip! 🤦🏼‍♀️",
    "emilia5": "💬 Her motto: 'Life is a state of mind.'"
