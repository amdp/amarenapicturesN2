    "title": "ABOUT",
    "main1": "Amarena Pictures is a production and direction company.",
    "main2": "It was born in 2011, distinguishing itself for its adaptivity and its ability to work quickly while maintaining effectiveness and high quality. We create different genre advertising films such as branded content, VR, or even videogames that have been broadcasted on TV, web, social media and internal or corporate communication channels. It is our pride to meet our clients and advertising agencies needs.",
    "main3": "<i>\"Amarena Pictures represents that unique taste made of a human side and an aesthetic research that is felt in all the contents we produce. This derives precisely from our love for what is 'human': even when we film Bulgari rings or an Alfa Romeo we still give a human touch in the moving images style: today the product itself is not more important than the desire, the history, and the choice of the consumer.\"</i>",
    "main4": "We have been working with top brands like FCA, Coca-Cola, Netflix, Lavazza, Bulgari, Tim, Mercedes, Mazda, Procter & Gamble, Beiersdorf, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Ministry of Health, and Presidency of the Council of the Ministers.",
    "main5": "Alessandro Merletti De Palo and Giovanni Caloro are two directors who have chosen to transform the pre-production, the set, and the post-production into a single pleasant, creative, non-mechanical path.",
    "main6": "Our goal is to combine precision, quality, promptness and maintaining at the same time a pleasant, artistic, and relaxed atmosphere from the B2B relationship during production.",
    "main7": "Thanks to the contribution of all the professionals involved and our producers - the \"amarena guys\" - we are always ready, available, and friendly ...with the constant intention to become impeccable.",
    "main8": "With Amarena, everything can be done with care and precision, in a caring and intelligent mood.",
    "main9": "THAT'S AMARENA!"

    "amdp1": "🍒👨🌈 Alessandro Merletti De Palo:",
    "amdp2": "Director and scientific researcher, founder of Amarena Pictures together with Giovanni Caloro.",
    "amdp3": "💗 He strongly believes in the potential of the people around him and, like Amarena Pictures, he loves diversity, not only of gender or sexual orientation but also of mindset, social class, and beliefs. 🎬 After several documentaries and a medium-length film, he's for his only time Spike Lee's assistant director in shooting a commercial film. This experience introduces him to the commercial film direction world. 🧠 On the scientific side, he presented his Cooperation Science theory at several international conferences including two Collective Intelligence Conferences held by MIT, one in Silicon Valley and a second one at the NYU Stern School of Business.",
    "amdp4": "❌ His love for creativity and diversity is so strong that he hates to repeat activities and concepts several times. Don't ask him to repeat! Very risky! 😂",
    "amdp5": "💬 His motto: 'Si Tu Bene Es Ego Quidem Valeo'",
    "gio1": "🍒👨🏻🌈 Giovanni Caloro:",
    "gio2": "🖖 He was born in Rome in 1981. Director, avant-gardener founder of Amarena Pictures together with Alessandro Merletti De Palo.",
    "gio3": "🎬 Vj and musician during his college days (thesis in theatre history, on 'The Representation of Hell in the Medieval Theatre'), fascinated by the interaction between music and images, he approaches directing by filming video clips, dance videos, and art videos. He only listens to music produced until 1995 (with very few exceptions), loves TV series, David Lynch, David Fincher and Stanley Kubrick. At home he only has 2 Dvds, both signed by the movie directors: Blue Velvet and The Matrix.",
    "gio4": "❌ If you're in a conference call with him: he's not shy, he just forgot to turn the microphone on! 😂",
    "gio5": "💬 His motto: 'Danzi mai col diavolo nel pallido plenilunio?'",
    "ari1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Arianna Giri:",
    "ari2": "Head of Production",
    "ari3": "🎥 Dynamic, sunny, decisive, tattooed. Very smart young girl, you recognize her immediately. She also worked in the editorial offices of Sky TG24 and Le Iene (Mediaset group), consolidating her practical knowledge of the field. 🍾 Her outstanding PR skills leave no one a chance: you are in the office with her and a second after you find yourself having an aperitif with a drink in your hand thanks to a pass for a special privée. 🔝 Active and extremely punctual in the production organization, she manages to skillfully navigate between calls to suppliers and relationships with agencies and customers. If you want to break the ice with ease and immediacy (and a couple of 'spritz'), you should contact her.",
    "ari4": "❌ Despite her slim physique ⚠️she does not eat healthy foods, fish, vegetables but only hamburgers, chips, nutella ... her beloved 'crap food'! 😂",
    "ari5": "💬 Her motto: 'Live with ambition to accomplish your dreams'",
    "bea1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Beatrice Caimi:",
    "bea2": "Assistant Producer",
    "bea3": "🎬 Bright, nerdy, she never wears black. ☀️ She graduated in languages and then attended a master in Tv studies. 📺 If she had to choose a century to live in, it would be the 1800s... you'd find her in a beautiful estate or in a castle. If she could, she'd live on the set of The Crown... but she would definitely settle for the Game of Thrones or the Star Wars sets. ⚠️ Never stop with her at a comic book store or a bookshop before a meeting, otherwise you'll regret it. In her free time she writes custom lists of tv shows for her friends to watch; Netflix's algorithm is nothing compared to her! She'll always be the first one to know what happens in any remote corner of the world: we call her BBC.",
    "bea4": "❌ Never put her to bed without pasta.",
    "bea5": "💬 Her motto: 'Do or do not... there is no \"try\"'",
    "cri1": "🍒👩🏻🌈 Cristiana Ragazzoni:",
    "cri2": "Business Relations",
    "cri3": "🎬 She could be the real \"certified nasty milanese\" but, more than being a cold engineer, she's a yoga instructor and a dog trainer. Eclectic, with an energy able to challenge a teenager, she's fond of: solving any problem you may propose her, climbing mountains like she were Spiderman, listening many kinds of music and having an adveturous attitude. She strongly believes a laugh will save the world and that a working day can be brought to 18 hours. She can speak with everything, even stones and it's useless trying to resist her. 🧠 Some say her best merit is being an engineer.",
    "cri4": "❌ Some say her worst flaw is being an engineer.",
    "cri5": "💬 Her motto: 'If you can dream it, you can do it.'",
    "emilia1": "🍒👩🏼🌈 Emilia Apperti:",
    "emilia2": "Producer",
    "emilia3": "☀️ Dynamic, extroverted and always smiling. The sun is her symbol and the color yellow is her spirit animal. It's impossible to make her sit still, she's always taking risks and running towards new challenges! There's no way to stop her creativity. 🎬 She has a business degree from Bocconi, with a thesis on how the cinema industry was influenced by streaming platforms: the movie theater is her second home. 💛 People say about her that she can make trees talk. Whatever the subject, she can engage in any conversation (it's way harder to make her stop talking): she believes her curiosity to be her most precious weapon. 🌈 Feminist to the core and incurable optimist: for her, problems do not exist, only solutions. Precise, strong, attentive to detail and always ready to bend over backwards to do a good job.",
    "emilia4": "❌ If she doesn't hear you when you call, or see you on the street, don't worry: she's just listening to music at full volume through her headphones, pretending she's in a videoclip! 🤦🏼‍♀️",
    "emilia5": "💬 Her motto: 'Life is a state of mind.'"
